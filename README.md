La Marzocco Micra Add-Ons

This repository contains scripts and configuration files designed to integrate the La Marzocco Micra espresso machine into a smart home environment using Home Assistant and ESPHome. These add-ons enhance functionality by enabling real-time monitoring, automation, and machine control.

Project Overview

This project connects the La Marzocco Micra to an ESP32-based LilyGO TTGO T-Display board, unlocking advanced features for monitoring and control.

Key Features

	‚Ä¢	Shot Timer Display
	‚Ä¢	Real-time shot timer is displayed on the LilyGO TTGO T-Display.
	‚Ä¢	Text sensor data is captured from the La Marzocco Micra and updated dynamically.
	‚Ä¢	Machine Control
	‚Ä¢	GPIO35 Button (ON CLICK): Toggles the machine ON/OFF.
	‚Ä¢	GPIO0 Button (ON CLICK): Enables or disables the steam boiler.
	‚Ä¢	Deep Sleep Mode
	‚Ä¢	Long Press GPIO0 (3 seconds): Puts the ESP32 board into Deep Sleep mode to save battery.
	‚Ä¢	Click GPIO35: Exits Deep Sleep and wakes up the controller.
	‚Ä¢	Battery Monitoring and Icons
	‚Ä¢	Displays battery percentage on the TTGO T-Display screen.
	‚Ä¢	Visual icons indicate:
	‚Ä¢	Power ON
	‚Ä¢	Steam Boiler ON

Setup Instructions

1. Home Assistant Hub

To get started, you need a working Home Assistant setup, which will serve as the central hub.
	‚Ä¢	Install Home Assistant on a dedicated server, such as a Raspberry Pi.
	‚Ä¢	Follow the official installation guide here: Home Assistant Raspberry Pi Installation.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure that the La Marzocco Micra is integrated with Home Assistant using the excellent work by Josef Zweck:
La Marzocco Integration.

2. ESPHome Configuration

The ESP32 board is configured using ESPHome, a tool that allows seamless integration with Home Assistant.
	‚Ä¢	Install ESPHome: Follow the ESPHome Getting Started Guide.
	‚Ä¢	Flash the ESP32 board with the provided YAML configuration file.
	‚Ä¢	Modify the configuration to match your environment:
	‚Ä¢	Update entity IDs for switches and text sensors.
	‚Ä¢	Verify GPIO pin mappings.

Once the board is configured, it will communicate with Home Assistant and display the shot timer on the TTGO screen.
